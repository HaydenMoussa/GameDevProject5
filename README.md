Seal Game


Intention:
Intended to be a top-down 2D game that explores steering behaviors and navigation for NPCs.


Narrative:
You’ve found yourself surrounded by some very strange seals that don’t like to get into the water… Help them find their way back to their nest!


Mechanics:
Navigate with WASD. Click to skip dialogue. 


Aesthetics: 
Pixel-art based sprites/tilemaps provide a cozy feeling to the game. Bright colors help to make the game feel more lively. A soft font enhances the cozy vibe. 


Joys & Struggles:
It was pretty difficult to manage the navigation/behaviors for the npcs, as well as set up the various levels. Otherwise, it was nice to work on a relatively simple 2D game with cute sprites.
